# Google-Sheets-Cash-Drawer
A Google Apps Script to transfer data to a history sheet about current cash count.

This was the first exposure I had to coding, outside of "programming" in Excel Spreadsheets.
The Drawer was a simple form calculating physical coins and tenders in the drawer.
A button served as the onclick call to the fuction, which then copied, pasted, and reset the form.
